Normally, you would need more than 1 plot to accomplish this, but {echarts4r} has a nifty \"timeline\" feature that makes it effortless to combine the two.\n\nI will use the #tidytuesday [data set](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-03-07/readme.md) from March 7, 2023. The data consists of sightings of the endangered Numbat, a carnivorous marsupial native to Australia. It's closest relative is the Tasmanian Devil. Sightings date back to 1856.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbats <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-03-07/numbats.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\nFirst, let's explore where Numbats have been spotted without respect to any time variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbats |>\n  drop_na(month) |> \n  leaflet() |>\n  addTiles() |> \n  addCircleMarkers(\n    lng = ~decimalLongitude,\n    lat =
